# CelestialBodiesProject
Computational Modelling Physics 305 Main Project

Below is the code for the Celestial Objects go Vroom! Project :)

The current idea is this:


1.  Set up the solar system and simulate the movement of planets.

2.  Launch asteroids towards Earth and test Jupiterâ€™s effect on asteroid impacts on Earth

3.  Simulate the path of space probes from launch to gravity-assist manoeuvres
  
4.  Simulate the path of the James Webb space telescope


The report and analysis is completed on Overleaf
